Udacity has helped me finish developing a simple weather app. What this course taught me:
Building a cloud-connected Android app to help me understand the tools, principles and patterns that underlie Android development using Android Studio. 
Project includes connecting to Open Weather Map API, adding permissions, initiating network I/O, using intents to navigate between Activities & implementing rich and responsive layouts.
